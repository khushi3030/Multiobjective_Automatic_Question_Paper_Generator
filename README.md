# Multiobjective_Automatic_Question_Paper_Generator
This is a system to generate multiple objective question papers using Abstract Syntax Tree and Genetic Algorithm. AQPGs are a useful tool for instructors and test takers. They can help create more difficult and interesting test questions while also ensuring fairness and saving time. The project's goal is to create a Regular Expression (Regex)-based Automatic Question Paper Generator. The system's main goal is to automate and streamline the process of writing exams for various educational reasons. The project seeks to provide a versatile and effective mechanism to construct question patterns, kinds, and constraints by utilizing the power of Regex expressions. This will make it possible for teachers and content producers to enter particular criteria for question generation, such as question forms, degree of difficulty, and subject-specific factors. The project's ultimate goals are to increase the effectiveness of question paper development, minimize manual labor, and guarantee the production of varied and well-structured question papers specifically designed for educational contexts
